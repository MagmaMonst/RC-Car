# RC-Car

I made this RC car using an ESP32, Motor driver, DC gear motors, and a metal chassis!!!

The code was made in Arduino IDE and i have used a switch case if loop for the entire movement logic. Basically what happens in the MIT app inventor code, is that each signal sent by the app to the ESP32 via bluetooth is coded as 'x\n', where x is any number. This is read by the ESP until the \n part, so it completely ignores it. Then, based on the number it reads, it performs a function.

I also have used MIT app inventor coz of its ease and how interactive it is to use. It only supports android phones tho :P. I had a ton of fun making this project and hope you like it!!!
